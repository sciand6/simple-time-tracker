# Simple Time Tracker Application
## Features
- Can add tasks that you've completed and enter the time you've completed them.
- Can flip between the next and previous days.
- Each day shows a list of tasks you've done/logged for that day. 
## Notable Packages
- React Query
- NextJS 13
- MongoDB
## Notes
- This project is being used to learn NextJS 13 and React Query.
- I noticed some open issues with NextJS and MongoDB that will probably be fixed by the time I'm bored of this project.
		- NextJS has an open issue regarding where to put the API routes in the project directory. They haven't figured out how that would look in the src/app folder yet.
		- MongoDB has an open issue regarding deleting items by index in an array field of a document. You'll notice a work around in the API route. 
## TODO
- Add a date picker to change the day you'd like to see instead of flipping between next/prev days.
- Add a method to edit tasks.
- Add CSS.
- Improve/optimize the code as always.
